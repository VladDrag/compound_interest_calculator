// The formula for compound interest, including principal sum, is:
// A = P (1 + r/n) ** (t * 12)  -> if t (time) is represented in years; else time is not multiplied by 12
// Where:
// A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
// P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
// r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
// t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for
// n = number of times interest is compounded
// https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php
// -------> Total = [ Compound interest for principal ] + [ Future value of a series ]
//--------> Total = [ P(1+r/n)^(nt) ] + [ PMT Ã— (((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)) ]
//TIME IS EXPRESSED IN YEARS!
