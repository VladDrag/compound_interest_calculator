Compound Interest Calculator
=

I always want to test an investing model - wether the sum or time are different, I wish to calculate it so I can ***efficiently and accurately*** plan ahead.
To do this I've started this project, where I plan to have it extended to cover multiple functionalities.


|***Compound Interest Calculator***|
-|

For our use, we shall have the following variables named as per below:
|variables|
|---|
|monthly regular payment  = pmt|
|time = time (*please note that the default time is given in years*)|
|principal = principal|
|rate = rate (*please note that the default rate is given in %*)|




Functionalities
-
These are the functionalities I wish to implement [^1]:
1) Total investment balance given the rate, principal, monthly contributions and time   ***[X]***
2) Rate required in order to reach a desired amount ***[ ]***
3) Time in which one will reach the desired amount ***[ ]***
4) Monthly regular payment required to reach the desired amount ***[ ]***
5) Principal required to reach the desired amount ***[ ]***

[^1]: Please note that for functionalities 2, 3, 4, 5 all the other data is to be given to the program
